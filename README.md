# Resume Oracle

Resume Oracle allows users to upload a resume and instantly get a list of jobs that match one's skills from [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/).

Created by Ethan Turok and Bill Sun for Columbia's Devfest Hackathon March 2022.

Work relies upon some code from (PyResParser](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pyresparser).
