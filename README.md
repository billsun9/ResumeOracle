# Resume Oracle

Resume Oracle allows users to upload a resume and instantly get a list of jobs that match one's skills from [Adzuna](https://www.adzuna.com/), a website that helps people to get jobs.

Created by Ethan Turok and Bill Sun for Columbia's Devfest Hackathon March 2022.

Work relies upon some code from [PyResParser](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pyresparser).
